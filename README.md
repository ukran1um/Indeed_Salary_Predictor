Salary_Predictor - a web scraping crawler built for Indeed that can search by keyword / location as well as a logistic regression classifier trained to predict whether the slary is above or below the median based on the job description and location. This uses some manual word vectorizing so that can be redone using the canned CountVectorizer method to develop more features. The next step would also be to wrap the standardization of the features into a pipeline and build a scraper tool where you can enter the search parameters and you get the position description along with a flag showing the above / below median result for each job that does not have a salary listed. Obviosly this is a crude tool and hinges on the assumption that the distribution of salaries in the job listings that show the salary range is similiar to that of the much larger set of job listings.
